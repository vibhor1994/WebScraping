# WebScraping

Python(2.7) with Cherrypy using redis

My first task of webscrapping using pyhton,cherrypy and redis as my cache database.
I have scraped data from top gainers table of nifty 50, then storing it in redis instance after that projecting that data in another web page.
I have used threads to update data on certain interval.
